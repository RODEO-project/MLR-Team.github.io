## Main objective

WP1 designs machine learning (ML) methods for instruction-based planning leveraging foundational models (FMs) and adapted to the context of multi-modal data in robotics.

- Developing frugal ML solutions
- Extending FMs to surgical robotics
- Exploring end-to-end instruction planning.

This research focus is coordinated by [Olivier Sigaud](_members/sigaud.md "Olivier Sigaud")
