## Main objective

This research focus designs new physics-informed "residual hybrid models/controllers" (RHMs/RHCs), which use machine learning (ML) to correct the Prior Physical Dynamics (PPDs) used in analytical controllers.

- Improving existing RHMs
- Extending them to partial observations
- Desiging controllers compatible with surgical robotics constraints

This research focus is coordinated by [Pascal Morrin](\_members/morin.md Pascal Morrin) and [Nicolas Perrin](\_members/perrin-gilbert.md Nicolas Perrin)
